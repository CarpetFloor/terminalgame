Desription: Cursor moving to wrong position.
Steps:
    1. Have word that spans multiple lines on left side.
    2. Move cursor to the row below the first line word is on, and to the column on the far-right side of the left side.
    3. Move cursor up onto word, so that even though word is highlighted, actual cursor position is character farthest to the right on first line word is on.
    4. Move right, and cursor should jump to a weird spot on the right side.
