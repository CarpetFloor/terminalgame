        <p><strong>Controls</strong></p>
        <p>-<u>Arrow keys</u> to move the cursor</p>
        <p>-<u>Enter / Space</u> to guess the word that the cursor is currently on.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Stuff Explained</strong></p>
        <p class="body">
                Your goal is to try to guess which word out of a few randomly generated words is the correct word.
            The words that you can guess from, and the only area that the cursor can move around in, are the 
            two vertical sections of text that will, at first glance, appear to be bunch of random characters.
            There are actual words in those sections of text, however they might be a little difficult to find.
            It is also worth noting that words can span multiple lines.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
                You only have three total guesses to find the correct password before you lose the game, which 
            is indicated at the top of the screen. To actually attempt to guess a password, you have to move 
            the cursor over to the word you want to guess, and when it is highlighted press <u>Enter</u> or 
            <u>Space</u>. After you make a guess, you will be shown information about your guess to the right of 
            the second vertical section of text. You will be told what your guess was, whether it was correct or 
            not, and if it was not correct, the similarity. The similarity number is how many letters are the 
            same between the word that you guessed and the actual password, <strong>not including duplicates</strong>.
            Meaning that the words 'guess' and 'password' would have a similarity value of 1. Basically, the 
            similarity value is a hint to guide you in determining what the actual password is. Also, after 
            guessing a word, it will become dotted out and unable to be guessed again.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
                Before explaining anything else, it is worth pointing out how you can get from one side of the 
            game to the other. When the cursor is at the right edge of the left side of the game and you press the 
            <u>Right Arrow Key</u>, the cursor will jump over to the right side. This also works the opposite way: if the 
            cursor is at the left edge of the right side of the game and you press the <u>Left Arrow Key</u>, the cursor 
            will jump over to the left side. Additionally, you can go from the left side to the right side by 
            pressing the <u>Down Arrow Key</u> when on the very-bottom line on the left side. Like horizontal movement, this 
            also works the opposite way: if you are the very-top line on the right side and press the <u>Up Arrow Key</u>, 
            the cursor will jump over to the left side.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
                As far as game difficulty, there are four total difficulties that slightly change the game. The harder 
            the game is, more words will be generated, and words will be longer too. The first three difficulty options 
            are the standard easy, medium, and hard, with the default option being easy. The fourth difficulty option is 
            extreme, and in addition to being harder than hard, also has some additional difficulties explained in the 
            settings menu where you can select your difficulty. Also, speaking of the settings menu, in addition to being 
            abnle to select the difficulty, you can also select the game color there.
        </p>
        <p class="body">
                Finally it is worth noting some issues you might experience. If you switch to a different tab or window 
            while the game is printing text out, everything will break and the game will be unplayable. The only 
            solution is to refresh the page, but this will reset all of the settings. A solution is in the works, but a 
            release date is still TBD. One other issue you might run into is if pressing any key does not do anything. 
            This could possible be caused from the game losing focus, so clicking anywhere in the tab should fix the 
            issue. Another thing to note is that this game has not been thoroughly tested, and so there might be some bugs.
